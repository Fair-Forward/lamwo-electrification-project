      <p>
        Sunbird AI is a non-profit based in Uganda. Sunbird AI uses artificial intelligence to advance
        sustainable development in Africa and works to strengthen the AI ecosystem in Africa. We work
        with partners to use data technology to improve planning, policy, decision-making, and
        strengthen the feedback loop between citizens and policy makers. Artificial intelligence in
        particular has the potential to help Africa leapfrog the traditional constraints of infrastructure to
        improve human wellbeing. To take full advantage of AI opportunities in Africa, we also help
        African public sector institutions increase capacities and improve policies.
